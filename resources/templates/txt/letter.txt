Dear Mr. Doe:
am
writing You concerning a recent purchase of widgets. Approximately two weeks ago, on October 1,
ordered a total of ५०
widgets for Company Inc. via the Widgets Galore client webpage
received an
email notification two days later confirming the receipt of payment and the shipment of the widgets
According to your website, shipments should reach their destination within ३५ business days of being
sent, but
have yet to receive the widgets. Do You have any information on what may have happened to
delay the shipment or where the shipment is currently?
have worked with Widgets Galore, Inc. in the past and have the greatest confidence in your products
and customer service.
We need the shipment of widgets soon, however, and
hoped you might be able
to provide me with an idea of when
can expect them. Thank you in advance for any help vou might be
able to offer.
Sincerely,
Sam Brown
Vice President of Company, Inc.
